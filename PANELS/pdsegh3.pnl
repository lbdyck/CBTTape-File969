%  COPY
`
`  Syntax:  COPY to-pdse
`
`  The to-pdse is optional
`
`  The COPY Command will display a popup panel asking for:
`
`      Target PDSE dataset name
`      Member name or mask
`      Create the target dataset (yes or no)
`      Replace members on copy   (yes or no)
`      Show a Progress Meter     (yes or no)
`
`      The Member name mask uses the same PDSEGEN member pattern
`      filtering options.
`
`      Create will create the target dataset using the same allocation
`      information as the current dataset, including the same PDSE
`      parameters.
`
`      When Create is specified you can change the space allocation
`      and the maxgen.
`
`      Replace does not apply if Create is specified.
`
`      Note that the copy will copy the member and generations while
`      retaining the relative generation order but the absolute
`      generation numbers will be lost and start over at 1.
`
`      The copy operation will copy from the oldest generation to
`      the newest and then the base member.  It does this to retain
`      the relative generation sequence (the absolute generation
`      number will be lost as there is no way to retain it). This
`      process also assures that the base member is retained along
`      with the most recent generations if copying to a PDSE with a
`      smaller MAXGEN value.
