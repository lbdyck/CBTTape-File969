%  ISPF Edit/View COMPARE
`
`  The%COMPare`command in ISPF Edit and View has been%extended`to allow
`  the ability to compare to another member generation within the current
`  PDSE. The traditional COMPARE syntax still works.
`
`  The new syntax to use this extension is:
`
`         Syntax:    COMPare member new-gen old-gen
`         Examples:  COMPare abc -2 0
`                    COMPare -3
`
`  If the generation is 0 then the command is the same as a compare
`  without the generation.
`
`  It is possible to compare other generations with the same member
`  name using this extension.
`
%  Note:`All standard Compare functions continue to work with this extension.
