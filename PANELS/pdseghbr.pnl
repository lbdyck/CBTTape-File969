%  BACKUP
`
`  The BACKUP Command will display a panel that provides the ability to
`  backup the specified PDSE dataset with all members and generations to a
`  new PDSE that can be easily backed up or copied with all generations
`  intact.
`
`  Each member and generation will be copied into the backup PDS, or PDSE,
`  as a unique member and will retain all ISPF statistics. The generation
`  (both absolute and relative) information will be stored in the $INDEX
`  member so that the relative generation numbers can be retained.
`  Unfortunately the absolute generation cannot be retained at this time.
`
`  The from PDSE must be a PDSE with generations enabled or an error
`  message will be generated.
`
`  The to PDSE must not exist as it will be allocated based on the DCB,
`  etc. of the from PDSE.
`
`  When using PDSEGEN on a PDSEGBAK PDS:
`
`  1. The $ALLOC member contains the MAXGEN specification for the original
`     PDSE. It may be changed prior to a RESTORE but it must never be more
`     than the system limit
`  2. ISPF Edit command GNAME can be used in Edit or View on a backup
`     member (members that start with @) to get information on the
`     real member name and generation information.
`  3. Member $BACKUP is the PDSEGBAK backup report
`  4. Member $INDEX is used during the RESTORE, and by the GNAME command,
`     to map the backup member name and generation to the real member
