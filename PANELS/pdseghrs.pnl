%  RESTORE
`
`  The RESTORE Command will display a panel that provides the ability to
`  RESTORE the specified PDSE backup dataset with all members and
`  generations to a new PDSE or existing PDSE.
`
` Panel fields:
`
`  PDSE Generation Backup: -pdsegen backup pds-
`  PDSE Target:            -target pdse to restore into-
`       Allocate Target:       (Y or N)
`
`  Optional fields:
`
`  Member Name: -member name or member mask-
`  Generation:  -generation selection using either absolute or relative-
`              (e.g. 0, -5, 47)
`
`  If the New option is selected then the backup PDSE will be restored to
`  a NEW PDSE that will be allocated based on the DCB, etc. of the backup
`  PDSE but will have the generations re-enabled. All members and
`  generations will be restored. The original absolute generation number
`  will be lost but the relative generation will be retained.
`
`  When using PDSEGEN on a PDSEGBAK PDS:
`
`  1. The $ALLOC member contains the MAXGEN specification for the original
`     PDSE. It may be changed prior to a RESTORE but it must never be more
`     than the system limit
`  2. ISPF Edit command GNAME can be used in Edit or View on a backup
`     member (members that start with @) to get information on the
`     real member name and generation information.
`  3. Member $BACKUP is the PDSEGBAK backup report
`  4. Member $INDEX is used during the RESTORE, and by the GNAME command,
`     to map the backup member name and generation to the real member
