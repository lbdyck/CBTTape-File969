`
`  HIGEN will add to the member list all High Water Gen (dummy) members.
`
`  A Dummy member is a member that holds information about a previously
`  deleted member. That information includes the highest absolute
`  generation that was used for the member before it, or it's generations,
`  were deleted.
`
`  After using the HIGEN command the member name will be added to the member
`  list with the date fields set to blank and the user set to HIGen.  The
`  relative generation will be '-' and the absolute generation will be
`  the highest absolute generation that was used when the member, and/or all
`  it's generations, were deleted.
`
`  HIGEN ? will display this tutorial panel.
