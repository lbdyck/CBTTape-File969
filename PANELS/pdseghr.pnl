%  Restrictions of PDSE V2 Generations:
`
`  1. The MAXGENS option defines the number of generations plus 1 for
`     the base or generation 0 member.  Thus a MAXGENS of 10 yields
`     11 members.
`
`  2. You can delete an individual generation and that will leave a
`     gap in the generations. This is not critical but is curious.
`
`  3. Use of TSO DELETE will delete the base member BUT will NOT
`     Delete any generations. The ISPF LMMDEL service will delete
`     the base member and ALL generations. This application uses
`     its own routine, PDSEGDEL, that uses the STOW delete generation
`     interface for delete processing.
`
`     - If you delete a member and all generations and then create a
`       new member with the same name. All generations for the new
`       member will start with the previous members generation next
`       high generation number.
`
`     - Some ISPF applications do not use LMMDEL to delete members
`       but use the equivalent of the TSO DELETE, with the same
`       results.
`
`  4. The use of ISPF copy services, including 3.3, will NOT copy
`     any generations. Nor will IEBCOPY. The only tool to copy
`     generations is DFDSS (a full dataset dump/restore/copy). This
`     application does not support copying at this time.
`
`  5. If you Edit a generation other than 0 and save it then no new
`     generation is generated. That only happens when editing
`     generation 0.
`
`    This option is not available with this application
`
`  6. You CANNOT access any generations using JCL or dynamic
`     allocation.
`
`  7. You can force a new generation, when editing generation 0, by
      using the Edit command SAVE NEWGEN.
`
`  8. You can prevent the creation of a new generation by using the
`     Edit command SAVE NOGEN
`
`  9. FTP (IBM's) does not support PDSE Member Generations.
`
` 10. The system PARMLIB and SYS1.PROCLIB must be a PDS and NOT a PDSE.
`     This is also true for all datasets referenced in MSTJCLxx.
`     (other proclib's may be PDSE)
