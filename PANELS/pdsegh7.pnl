%  Promote (P) and RECover (G)
`
`  Promote and Recover are designed to take a non-0 generation and make
`  it a generation 0 member so that it can be used by other programs.
`
`  Promote will take the non-0 generation member and replace the base
`  generation 0 member with the non-0 generation. This will push the
`  current generation 0 member to the -1 generation.
`
`  Recover will prompt the user for a new member name and then copy all
`  records from the non-0 generation to the new member.
