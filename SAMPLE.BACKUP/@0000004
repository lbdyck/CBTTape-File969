This is a sample PDSE with members and generations. The purposes of
this PDSE is to provide a sample to be used with PDSEGEN, and other
applications, to demonstrate the usefulness of generations.

This PDSE will be backed up using PDSEGEN and distributed in TSO
Transmit format in the PDSEGEN package. It will need to be restored
using PDSEGEN using the RESTORE command to reconstitute it as a PDSE.

The PDSE is being created with a MAXGEN of 5. If the target site has a
site limit less than 5 then those generations beyond that limit will be
'lost'.

The members of this PDSE are:

    BACKREST    - doc on sample backup and restore
    COMMANDS    - list of primary commands
    GHOSTS      - small writeup on ghosts in PDSE's
    LINEOPS     - list of line selection options
