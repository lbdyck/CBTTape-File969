A PDSE with member generations may contain dummy members. These are
members for which there is a directory entry but no real member or in
some cases there is a former member or generation that were deleted. This
is an artifact of the way PDSE's clean up or remove deleted members and
generations.

PDSEGEN attempts to hide all dummys since they can not be opened.

These dummy members retain the highest absolute generation that was used
by the member prior to the member and/or all of it's generations being
deleted.
