A PDSE with member generations may contain dummy members. These are
members that are created to hold information on the highest generation
that was used for a generation for a specific member. If a member has
never had any generations then there will be no dummy generation membr
for it. If a member has active generations then the dummy generation
member will not exist. If all generations for a member have been deleted
then the dummy generation member will exist. If a member, and all it's
generations, have been deleted then the dummy generation member will
exist.

PDSEGEN attempts to hide all dummys since they can not be opened.
