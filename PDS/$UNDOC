There are some undocumented primary and line commands:

Primary Commands:

ACHmed - used to allow the display in the member list of dummy members
       - the absolute generation for these dummy members is the high
         water mark of absolute generations for that member and where
         the generation count will resume if/when the member is
         recreated.
       - Entering Achmed ? will bring up a short tutorial about Achmed
       - Aliases are Casper and Zombie

Line Commands:

W      - Allows editing generations directly as PDSEGEN
         automatically converts an Edit to View
