The PDSEGEN ISPF Dialog found in this package will present the user with
a list of all members of their PDSE, including all generations.  There
are many commands including Copy and Compare, and many line selection
options available, including Browse, Edit, View, Compare, Delete, J
(submit), Promote, Rename and Recover.  The list of members will be
updated appropriately as members are edited, added, deleted, recovered,
or promoted. This application will also work with non generation enabled
PDSE's and PDS's.

In addition the PDSEGBAK and PDSEGRST applications are packaged with
PDSEGEN - see the doc in @BACKUP

* -------------------------- REQUIREMENTS ------------------------------ *
*  This application requires z/OS 2.1 or newer to support access via     *
*  ISPF to generations and does NOT support load libraries or aliases    *
*  at this time.                                                         *
*                                                                        *
*  APAR OA43951 and OA43952 are pre-reqs as it adds the system           *
*  maximum generation limit to the data facilities area (DFA)            *
*  control block which is used by this application. This closed          *
*  in December 2013 so most shops should have this.                      *
* ---------------------------------------------------------------------- *

Installation of this dialog is documented in the $INSTALL member. It
does involve:

   - Copy the ISPF Panels into your ISPF Panel library
   - Copy the REXX Execs into your SYSEXEC library
   - Copy the LOAD modules into your ISPLLIB library
   - Optional assemble the source code provided
     - see member ASMJCL

For testing and validation purposes you can use the PDSEGENX exec which
will Altlib the exec library and Libdef the panels and load library and
then invoke PDSEGEN. PDSEGENX will accept an optional pdse-library as
the only parameter but if omitted then the user will be prompted for the
PDSE to work with.

MVS/QuickRef - if you have MVS/QuickRef installed then consider installing
member PDSEGQW into a MVS/QuickRef database (see QWLOAD for sample JCL).

USAGE.

Entry to the dialog is via the PDSEGEN exec. If called with no parameters
then a prompting panel is displayed.

    Syntax is:  %PDSEGEN dsname filter set

    Where dsname is the dataset name for a PDSE with generations.

    If dsname is * then a display of the last 15 referenced datasets
    will be presented to select from.

    If dsname is ? then the ISPF tutorial will be presented.

    The dsname may also contain a filter - 'sys1.parmlib(ieasys*)'

    Where filter is any valid filter.

       Filter are:  ABC*, ABC: ,ABC, ABC/, /ABC, or ABC
                    TODAY, WEEK, MONTH, YEAR, SINCE YY/MM/DD, SINCE -nn
                    YESTERDAY, SINCE day-of-week (SUnday, Monday, ...)

       The date filters are toggles.

    Where SET is SET=x where x is B, E, V, or / to define the
    default select. This over-rides anything the user may have
    set in the entry panel or using the SET command and is
    saved in the ISPF profile.

PDSEGEN may also be entered on a DSLIST or ISPF 3.4 dataset list in
the command field with a / to indicate to use the dataset on that row
as the PDSE to work with.

To simplify entering PDSEGEN on DSLIST or 3.4 you can create this
simple exec that I call PG, but you can all it whatever is easy for you:

        /* rexx */
        arg options
        '%pdsegen' options

        *** This is provided in the EXEC PDS as member PG ***

Within the application there are commands available on the ISPF Command
line and Line selection commands for each member. See the ISPF Tutorial
for all commands and options available.

       Placing the cursor on the row and hitting ENTER will also
       select the row.

    * - ONLY allowed for generation 0 members
   ** - ONLY work with non-0 generation members

Notes:
   - All line selection options can be used in block form - BB/BB or B99
   - Expanded commands may also be blocked by doubling the 1st character,
     e.g. KKlone, but expanded commands may not have a count
   - When using the expanded selection panel then any TSO command, clist,
     or exec can be used along with any valid line selections. The User
     command dialog will be presented to allow the user to enter other
     parameters.

Why use, or consider, PDSEGEN:

   1. To see the generations easily
   2. To be able to compare current generation to prior generations to
      see what changed (broke)
   3. To easily recover a prior generation using recover to a new member
      or promote to replace the current base member
   4. To easily clean up obsolete, no longer needed, generations (prune)
   5. To safely copy the base member and all generations
   6. To easily backup and restore without loss of generations
   7. Protection from accidentally editing a non-0 generation
   8. Easily search members and generations
   9. Easy access to up to 15 datasets
   10. Info on which generation is being browsed/edited/viewed
   11. All the above and more

Customization options are all found in the PDSEGENS exec:

   1. Change the mail variable to 1 to enable e-mailing the selected
      member or 0 to disable the e-mail option.
   2. Enable or disable the elapsed time display after building the
      member list - change etime variable to 0 to disable and 1 to
      enable it.
   3. Enable or disable processing of dummy members by changing the
      higen variable. 0 = off and 1 = on.
   4. Added base_color and sort_color for the columns that can be sorted
      to allow changing those colors if desired. Default is blue for
      unsorted and turq for sorted.
   5. Enable or disable the IEBPDSE Clean option
      - Requires IBM Apar OA47755 or OA50214 for this support
   6. Update the help panels that document sample JCL for batch Backup
      and Copy to conform to your installation standards and datasets,
      PDSEGHBJ for Backup and PDSEGHC for Copy.
   7. If your installation has a Edit Line Command Table defined in your
      ISPF configuration *AND* it isn't in the ISPF Table dataset
      defined in the sample batch JCL for Backup and Copy then those
      samples need to be updated to concatenate that dataset.

Notes:

1.  Browse works as you would expect it to

2.  Using Edit or View you can use all normal edit commands,
    including edit macros. However commands that reference other
    members can only reference the base, or generation 0, member.

3.  Multiple members may be selected for Browse or View but Edit
    will only work if the member IS NOT saved or updated.  If a
    member is saved or updated then all rows for that member are
    deleted and re-added to include the updated generation info.

4.  It shouldn't have to be stated but generations are only
    supported for PDSE Version 2 datasets where generations have
    been enabled.

5.  Edit will be converted to View for non-0 generation members.

6.  The Compare command only accepts relative generation numbers.

7.  The Compare line option will compare the base member to the
    selected generation.

8.  It is possible to allow Edit to edit a generation BUT when that
    happens only the generation is updated and the base member is
    NOT updated. Thus the generation with the update could be lost
    and/or hidden since it is not possible to access a generation
    using dynamic allocation or JCL.

    This application has been configured to prevent editing non-0
    generations.

9.  The ISPF Edit compare command has been extended using an edit
    macro. The new capabilities include the ability while in Edit to
    compare to another generation of that member (e.g. compare -2)
    or to compare to another member generation (e.g. compare xx -3).
    When in view it is possible to compare to the base (e.g. compare 0)
    or to another member or generation (e.g. compare xxx -1). If the
    compare options do not include a generation then the normal ISPF
    compare will be invoked.

10. The e-mail option utilizes XMITIP using the XMITIPFE (front end)
    exec. This option is only available if the mail variable is
    customized to 1.

11. Aliases are NOT supported by the PDSEGENI Rexx Function so this
    application does not support aliases (at this time)

12. Rename will rename the base member and all generations by doing a
    copy of the generations so they are retained.

13. Find can be faster if Filter is used prior to the find

14. Prune operates on only the members in the display list so
    using Filter before Prune is a good way to limit the members
    that Prune will clean up.

15. Before using Prune a Backup is recommended (CYA).

16. PDSEGEN supports extended statistics. If a member has more than 64K
    (65535) records then the only way to display the actual record count
    is to turn on extended statistics using the ISPF Edit command STATS
    EXT.

17. When Hide is active, Delete, Prune, and Rename are not available.

18. The Member list display defaults to a 2 digit year display. Using the
    Left or Right keys (F10 or F11) will shift to use the 4 digit year
    display by removing the Initial size field from the table. This view
    is remembered across sessions.

19. If you see a member with a -1 generation and there is no 0 generation
    that indicates that the member was deleted outside of PDSEGEN. The
    normal ISPF member delete will delete the base member but leave the
    generations and the base member will become the -1 generation.

before using in any productive capacity.

Restrictions of PDSE V2 Generations:

1. The MAXGENS option defines the number of generations plus 1 for the
   base or generation 0 member.  Thus a MAXGENS of 10 yields 11 members.
2. You can delete an individual generation and that will leave a gap
   in the generations. This will result in this application stopping its
   member search at the 1st gap.
   * this option is not available with this application
3. Use of TSO DELETE will delete the base member BUT will NOT Delete
   any generations. The ISPF LMMDEL service will delete the base
   member and ALL generations. This application uses the LMMDEL
   service.
   - If you delete a member and all generations and then create a new
     member with the same name. All generations for the new member
     will start with the previous members generation next high
     generation number.
   - Some ISPF applications do not use LMMDEL to delete members but
     use the equivalent of the TSO DELETE, with the same results.
4. The use of ISPF copy services, including 3.3, will NOT copy any
   generations. Nor will IEBCOPY. The only tool to copy generations
   is DFDSS (a full dataset dump/restore/copy). This application does
   not support copying at this time.
5. If you Edit a generation other than 0 and save it then no new generation
   is generated. That only happens when editing generation 0.
6. You CANNOT access any generations using JCL or dynamic allocation.
7. You can force a new generation, when editing generation 0, by using
   the Edit command SAVE NEWGEN.
8. You can prevent the creation of a new generation by using the Edit
   command SAVE NOGEN
9. To find what PDSEGBAK member maps to what real name use Edit (or View)
   on the backup member and use the ISPF Edit command GNAME
10. See the Tutorial option U for a list of vendor products that have no
    or partial support for member generations
