PDSEGDEL

This is a REXX function that uses the STOW DG (delete generation)
interface to delete individual members and individual generations
in a member generation enabled PDSE Library.

Usage is rc = pdsegdel(member,generation,ddname)

Where:     member is the member name to be deleted

           generation is the absolute generation to be deleted
           or zero to delete the member and all generations

           ddname is the pre-allocated DD of the PDSE Library

The return code is 0 for success or 4 if not.

PDSEGENI

This is a REXX function that will return in the stem member.
information on all members in the PDS or PDSE Library, including
generation information. It should not be used on a load library as
it is not designed for them.

Usage is:  rc = pdsegeni(ddname)

Where the ddname is preallocated to the desired library.

The returned member.0 stem contains the number of members returned.
This includes both members and generations.

The format of the member.x stem is:

     Field    start length
     ID       0     4   PDSE
     Member   5     8
     absgen   14    6
     vrm      22    6
     cdate    35    7   yyyyddd
     aliasflg 43    1   Y or N
     ttr      46    3
     mdate    49    7   yyyyddd
     mtime    56    7   0hhmmss
     userid   63    8
     mod      72    2   hex
     cur size 75    5
     init size 79   4
     dummy flg 83   1   'D' for dummy generation

PDSEGMAT

This routine is used for pattern matching and supports:

   * - any number of any characters
   % - any single character

Usage:

    rc = pdsegmat(member,pattern)

    rc = 1 if ok, 0 if not
